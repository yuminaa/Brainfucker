# Brainfucker

A slightly unhinged attempt at writing a JIT compiler for the Brainfuck language in ARM64 assembly, because why not?

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This compiler is currently about as functional as a chocolate teapot. It's written in ARM64 assembly because apparently, I enjoy pain and suffering.

> [!WARNING]
> This compiler is not usable in its current state because I keep getting segfaults.
